Concise is unit testing framework that uses plain English and minimal code. It
extends and is fully compatible with existing PHPUnit projects.

Highlights include:

 * 100% compatible with PHPUnit, no changes required. You may use as many
   features as you wish.
 * Much better `mocking framework`_ with a lot less typing.
 * Huge array of `assertions`_ to save on boilerplate code.
 * Assert and `verify`_ are supported.
