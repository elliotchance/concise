Concise is unit test framework for using plain English and minimal code, built on PHPUnit.

Simple Example
--------------

```php
class AttributeTest extends TestCase
{
    public function testAssertionsCanBeBuiltWithChaining()
    {
        $result = 100 + 23;
        $this->assert($result, exactly_equals, 123);

        $a = ['foo' => 'bar'];
        $this->assert($a, is_an_associative_array);
        $this->assert($a, has_key, 'foo', with_value, 'bar');
    }

    public function testAssertionsAreJustStrings()
    {
        $this->assert('123 equals "123"');
    }

    public function testAttributesAreNativelyUnderstood()
    {
        $this->foo = 'bar';
        $this->assert('foo is the same as "bar"');
    }
}
```

Mocking
-------

Mocking is much easier in concise, you no longer need to specify which method to mock:

```php
$calculator = $this->mock('\My\Calculator')
                   ->expect('add')->with(3, 5)->andReturn(8)
                   ->stub('clear')->andThrow(new \CantClearException())
                   ->expect('subtract')->never()
                   ->get();
```

Mocks will throw an exception for any method that is called that isn't told what to do. So maybe you need a
`niceMock`? Nice mocks work exactly like the original class but allows you to specify how to handle specific
methods:

```php
$calculator = $this->niceMock('\My\Calculator')
                   ->stub(['add' => 8])          // always return 8 for add()
                   ->get();
```

### Adding Custom Matchers

Create the matcher class:

```php
class MyMatcher extends \Concise\Matcher\AbstractMatcher
{
	/**
	 * @return array All of the syntaxes this matcher will respond to.
	 */
	public function supportedSyntaxes()
	{
		return array(
			'? equals ?',
			'? is equal to ?'
		);
	}
	
	/**
	 * Perform the match.
	 * @param string $syntax The syntax that we are evaluating (like '? equals ?').
	 * @param array $data Placeholders are matched to indicies of $data.
	 * @return TRUE on success, FALSE for failure.
	 */
	public function match($syntax, array $data = array())
	{
		return ($data[0] == $data[1]);
	}

	public function getTags()
	{
		return array(\Concise\Matcher\Tag::BASIC);
	}
}
```

Somewhere in your test (or your bootstrap) you can get the default parser and register your class:

```php
$defaultParser = \Concise\Syntax\MatcherParser::getInstance();
$defaultParser->registerMatcher(new MyMatcher());
```
